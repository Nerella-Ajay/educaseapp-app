# React JS Assignment Reference Document

## Objective

Create a pixel-perfect React JS application based on the provided Adobe XD design, ensuring a clean, well-formatted codebase. The application should feature a centered mobile app interface on the webpage with seamless and efficient navigation between pages. The final project must be hosted on a platform like Vercel, and the code should be shared via a public GitHub repository.

## Requirements

### 1. Design Implementation

- **Design Source**: Use the Adobe XD design provided at https://xd.adobe.com/view/b68eea25-003d-4a5d-8fdd-d463eeb20b32-e3dd.
- **Pixel-Perfect Design**: The implemented interface must match the Adobe XD design exactly in terms of layout, colors, typography, spacing, and other visual elements.
- **Mobile App Interface**:
    - The mobile app interface should be centered on the webpage.
    - Ensure the design is responsive, maintaining the mobile app appearance as per the Adobe XD prototype, even on larger screens.
- **Navigation**: Implement smooth and efficient navigation between pages as defined in the Adobe XD design, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### 2. Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: Use React JS to build the application.
- **Code Quality**:
    - Write clean, well-structured, and well-commented code.
    - Follow consistent formatting (e.g., use Prettier or ESLint for code formatting).
    - Organize the codebase using a modular structure (e.g., separate components, styles, and utilities).
- **Styling**:
    - Use modern CSS techniques (e.g., CSS-in-JS, styled-components, or Tailwind CSS) for styling.
    - Ensure the styling matches the Adobe XD design precisely.
- **Dependencies**:
    - Use CDN-hosted React and related dependencies (e.g., React, ReactDOM) from a reliable source like `cdn.jsdelivr.net`.
    - Optionally use Babel for JSX support.
- **Form Handling**:
    - Avoid using `<form>` elements with `onSubmit` due to sandbox restrictions. Use alternative methods like button click handlers for form submissions.
    - Use `className` instead of `class` for JSX attributes.

### 3. Hosting and Submission

- **GitHub Repository**:
    - Create a public GitHub repository to host the project code.
    - Ensure the repository includes a clear `README.md` with instructions for running the project locally.
    - Commit code frequently with meaningful commit messages.
- **Hosting**:
    - Deploy the application on a hosting platform such as Vercel, Netlify, or a similar service.
    - Ensure the hosted application is accessible and functional.
- **Deliverables**:
    - Share the link to the public GitHub repository.
    - Share the hosted application link (e.g., Vercel or Netlify URL).

### 4. Additional Notes

- **Adobe XD Context**: Adobe XD is currently in maintenance mode, but the provided design link should be accessible for viewing the prototype.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure the application works in all modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- **Performance**: Optimize the application for fast loading and smooth interactions.
- **Documentation**: Include comments in the code to explain key components or logic, and document any setup or deployment steps in the `README.md`.

### 5. Evaluation Criteria

- **Design Fidelity**: How closely the implementation matches the Adobe XD design.
- **Code Quality**: Cleanliness, modularity, and readability of the codebase.
- **Functionality**: Seamless navigation and functionality of the application.
- **Deployment**: Successful hosting and accessibility of the deployed application.
- **Repository**: Organization and documentation in the GitHub repository.

## Submission Instructions

- Submit the following:
    - **GitHub Repository Link**: A public GitHub repository containing the complete codebase.
    - **Hosted Application Link**: A URL to the deployed application on Vercel, Netlify, or a similar platform.
- Ensure both links are functional and accessible before submission.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
